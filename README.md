Takeaway

Takeaway restaurant (Makers Academy week2)

###Problem Description

Write a Takeaway program.

Implement the following functionality:
list of dishes with prices
placing the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. 
Use twilio-ruby gem to access the API
Use a Gemfile to manage your gems

Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.
